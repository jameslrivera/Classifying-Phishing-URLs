# **Classifying Phishing URLs**

This project is focused on identifying phishing websites by analyzing their URLs. Various machine learning models are employed to determine the effectiveness of different approaches in detecting phishing websites.

## **Project Overview**

Phishing websites aim to deceive users into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials or financial details. This project uses machine learning models to classify URLs as either **phishing** or **non-phishing**.

### **Goals**:
- Build and compare machine learning models.
- Analyze the contribution of different features to classification accuracy.
- Save results from each model for comparison.

## **Features**

Each URL is analyzed to extract the following features:

1. **HTTPS Presence**: Whether the URL uses HTTPS (`1` if present, `0` otherwise).
2. **URL Length**: The total number of characters in the URL.
3. **Special Character Length**: The number of special characters in the URL.
4. **Number of Dots**: The count of `.` characters.
5. **Number of Slashes**: The count of `/` characters.
6. **Total Special Characters**: Sum of occurrences of specific special characters (`!@#$%^&*()-=`).
7. **Domain Type**:
   - Common domains like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.me`.
   - Other domains are categorized separately.
8. **Group Features**:
   - **Mean URL Length by Domain**: Average URL length for each domain type.
   - **Deviation from Mean URL Length**: Difference between a URL's length and the average length for its domain.

## **Models**

The following models are implemented to classify URLs:

### **1. Logistic Regression**
- Simple linear classifier.
- Used as a baseline to compare against other models.

### **2. Naive Bayes**
- Probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem.
- Assumes feature independence.

### **3. Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP)**
- Neural network with a single hidden layer.
- Sigmoid activation for binary classification.

### **4. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
- Neural network with 2 hidden layers, each containing 10 nodes.
- Uses ReLU activation for hidden layers and sigmoid for output.

### **5. Deep Neural Network (DNN)**
- Neural network with 10 hidden layers, each containing 30 nodes.
- Designed for more complex patterns in the data.

Each model was implemented using either **Scikit-learn** (for logistic regression and Naive Bayes) or **PyTorch** (for SLP, MLP, and DNN). The neural networks are trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 16.
## **Dataset**
---

The dataset contains URLs labeled as either:
- **Good**: Non-phishing URLs.
- **Bad**: Phishing URLs.

The dataset is preprocessed to extract features for training and testing the models. It is stored as a CSV file: `phishing_site_urls.csv`.
